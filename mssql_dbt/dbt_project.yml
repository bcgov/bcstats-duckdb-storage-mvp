  # - **Ensure dbt_utils is Installed**: The `dbt_utils.get_relations_by_prefix()` function is part of the `dbt_utils` package. If you don’t have it installed, you can add it to your `packages.yml`:
#
#   ```yaml
#   packages:
#     - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
#       version: 1.3.0  # Check for the latest version
#   ```
#
#   After adding this, run `dbt deps` to install the package.


# Setting quote_columns: False ensures that dbt doesn't wrap column names in quotes, which can sometimes lead to case sensitivity issues in SQL Server.

# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.

#   +quoting:
#     database: false
#     schema: false
